Originally created for use in a game I am developping using C99: [Codename Firesaga](https://gitlab.com/Gabinou/firesagamaker). Title pending. 

## Installation
Add ```darr.h``` to your source code.

## Features
Single file library.

## Motivation
Make a very simple dynamic array. 
Be type agnostic.
