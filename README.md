# DARR (Dynamic Arrays) 

Dynamic arrays for C99. A darr is basically an array with two additional elements, allocated length and number of active element saved at positions -2 and -1 respectively. 

Tutorial is included in ```darr.h```.

Originally created for use in a game I am developping using C99: [Codename Firesaga](https://gitlab.com/Gabinou/firesagamaker). Title pending. 

## Installation
Add ```darr.h``` to your source code.

## Features
Single file library.

## Motivation
Make a very simple dynamic array. 
Be type agnostic.
C99.
